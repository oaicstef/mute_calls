# Mute Teams api
### The purpose of this project is to give a way to mute a Microsoft Teams call using an API and SendKeys to send the CTRL+SHIFT+m keys combination.
I'm using this api with my Sony wl-1000xm5 which doesn't have the mute microphone feature out of the box. Now, I will be able to use my Headset and mute my calls using my mobile.

### This repository will also include an easy Flutter app to call the rest api.
